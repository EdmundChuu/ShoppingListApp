# My Personal Project Shopping LIst 

## Task 1 + Task 2
For this project I will make a shopping list. This project aims to create a user-friendly digital tool designed to simplify the process of creating and managing shopping lists. . The primary goal is to streamline the shopping experience and make it more organized and convenient for users.

**What will the application do?**
The application will provide a platform where users can create, edit, and manage their shopping lists. It will support features such as adding new items, categorizing items by departments or types, setting quantities, marking items as purchased, and clearing completed items from the list.

**Who will use it?**
The application is designed for anyone who needs assistance in organizing their shopping needs. It will cater to individuals or households looking to streamline their grocery shopping, maintain ongoing shopping lists, and reduce the chances of forgetting items and/or using paper and pen to list the things. 

**Why is this project of interest to you?**
This project is intriguing because it merges practical utility with the opportunity to design an intuitive UI. Creating a tool that simplifies everyday tasks aligns with my passion for enhancing productivity through technology and improving daily life by making an app that can be useful to everyone. Moreover, the challenge of developing features that cater to different shopping preferences and habits adds an element of creativity and problem-solving that I find both stimulating and rewarding.
